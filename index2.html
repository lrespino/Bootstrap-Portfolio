            <p>I am a full-stack web developer. I have 3-5 years experience with the following tools: HTML5, CSS,
                JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, C#, Office VBA, Bootstrap, and Git version control. I have work completely independently on most projects, forcing me to be resourceful and tenacious. This also quickly taught me to make decisions on which "rabbit holes" to go down and which not to so I could keep moving forward on projects. I look forward to being part of a team to become even more productive. I am confident that my personality and demeanor will allow me to easily fit in with any team.</p>
            <p>I also have expertise in video and audio production using tools like Avid Media Composer, Avid Pro Tools,
                and Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Photoshop and Illustrator. I have a background in education through 5
                years of teaching and 1 year of serving as department chair of a bachelor degree program which I built.
                This wide range of experience makes me very capable and comfortable with "speaking the language" of other
                business units within a company.</p>
            <p>I enjoy spending my spare time with my wife and kids. We travel quite a bit, and I play a lot of
                Rocket League on the Xbox One with my 7 year-old son (who is probably a little better than me!).</p>
            <p>Please take a look at my portfolio and contact me to let me know what you think.</p>
